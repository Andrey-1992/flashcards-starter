# FlashCards Starter Kit

### Description
- For this project, I created a game playable through the command line. This game showed a "card" with a question and 3 possible answers. The user chooses their answer and the game does not move on until the correct answer is chosen. 


### How it Works
- Clone the SSH link to your computer
- CD into the directory
- Start the game by typing 'node index.js' in the console
- Use the number keys 1, 2, and 3 to answer each question.
- Your percentage correct will appear at the end of the round.

### Technologies Implemented
- JavaScript
- Git & Github
- Mocha & Chai

### Future Updates
- Add a second data set to study a different topic
